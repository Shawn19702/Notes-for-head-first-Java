Java is typed in a sourced code, goes thorugh a compiler made from bytescodes, outputs a code, and then you would run the Java program by starting virtual machine.
data types end in ;
You declare an interger varible by using a name and a type for example "int a"
a source code with the java extension holds a single defination
a class has one or multiple methods
for methods within curly braces you write instructions for how the method should be perfomed
When JVM starts to it searches for the class you gave it at the command line
When writting Java everything goes into a class
You can do statemnts, loops, and branching within a class
Java has three looping constructs called while, do-while. and for
Java is a language that is object-oriented
system.out.print.ln inserts a new line and system.out print repeatedly keeps printint the same line.
The comoplier in Java stops violations before they get to the user
overriding means that a subclass redefines one of its inherited methods
The things an object know about itself is called instance variables
The things an objects peforms is called methods
A class is not object but a class it used to contructs objects
A dot operatior gives you acces to a objects state and behavior
Main tests a class
Main also launches starts a Java Application
A java program is a pile of classes
A class is compiled from a java file, behaves like a template, declares methods, and creates object instances
They are two types of variables called primitive and reference 
All variables must have a type and a name
Object variables dont exist there is only an object variable
An object refernce is just another variable value
All refrences given to a JVM will be the same size regardless of the size of the objects
An array variable controls an array object
Arrays are also objects
Objects have state and behavior called instance variables and methods
A claas descibes an object and what an object does
A method uses parameters 
A caller passes arguments
